## What’s the best way to read and understand someone else’s code?
###1. Find one thing you know the code does, and trace those actions backward, starting at the end.

Say, for example, you know that the code you’re viewing ultimately creates a file with a list of movie titles. Figure out where in the code — the specific, few lines — it generates that file.

Then, move one step backward and figure out how it places the info in the file.

Then, move another step backward and figure out where the info came from.

And so on…

Let’s call those connected pieces of code a “chain of actions.”

Inevitably, using this approach will lead you through a bunch of different areas of the code. And that will probably give you a good deal of insight into things such as:

how the body of code is organized (where variables are defined, where different types of functions are located, etc.)
the person’s style of coding
how the person who wrote the code thinks and problem solves (this is harder to describe, but it comes intuitively the more examples you see)
And by doing that, you’ll gradually begin to understand more and more of that full body of code. So where you started with:

[ a big file of code that doesn’t really mean much at all to you ]

you’ll now be looking at:

[ still a big file of code, but where you now understand a few specific sections ]

It’s almost as if you were originally standing in a room that was pitch-black, and, one at a time, different lights throughout the room were turned on to gradually reveal more details of the room’s appearance.

###2. Rinse and repeat.

Repeat that process multiple times, and you’ll rapidly increase your understanding of more and more pieces of the overall codebase.

Just as parts of the pitch-black room are gradually illuminated, parts of the code gradually “light up” for you, as you understand how they function.

The reason that works well is that, in all cases, a body of code is designed to tackle one (or more) complex problems. So you’ll always have those “chains of actions” throughout.

And the more you can gain an understanding of how different parts of the code are connected, the more you’ll develop an understanding of the entire codebase, as a whole.

And, over time, the more (good) code you see, the easier it becomes to read and understand all code, and the faster you can do so.

..which leads directly into the second reason I love this question: it highlights the importance of exposure to high quantity, high quality examples of expertise.

In programming, “high quality examples of expertise” = good code that other programmers wrote.
